### Phase 4.5: S2I Build Integration for OpenShift (NEW - 2025-01-08)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (release-4.18 branch - 2025-01-09)
**Priority:** High - Resolves OpenShift SCC permission issues
**Objective:** Implement automatic container image building using OpenShift S2I to eliminate runtime pip installation failures
**Based on:** ADR-023 (S2I Build Integration), ADR-024 (Missing requirements.txt Fallback), ADR-025 (Community Build Methods)

#### Background and Problem Statement

**Current Issue:**
- OpenShift Security Context Constraints (SCC) assign random UIDs to containers
- Standard Jupyter images expect UID 1000 and write to `/home/jovyan`
- Runtime pip installation fails with "Permission denied" errors
- Environment variable workarounds (`HOME=/workspace`, `PYTHONUSERBASE=/workspace/.local`) are unreliable

**Industry Pattern:**
- Azure ML, AWS SageMaker, Google Vertex AI all pre-build images before execution
- Immutable images provide better security, reproducibility, and performance
- OpenShift S2I provides native capability for automatic image building

**Solution:**
- Use OpenShift S2I to build custom images with dependencies before notebook execution
- Eliminate runtime pip installation entirely
- Support notebooks with and without requirements.txt files

#### Tasks

### Phase 5: CI/CD Testing Infrastructure (Weeks 5-6) - NEW

**Status:** 🔄 IN PROGRESS (60% complete - 2025-11-11)
**Objective:** Implement comprehensive CI/CD testing strategy with dual testing environments
**Based on:** ADR-032 (GitHub Actions CI), ADR-033 (E2E Testing), ADR-034 (Dual Testing), ADR-035 (Test Tier Organization), ADR-036 (Private Test Repository)

#### Background and Motivation

After completing ADR-031 (Tekton Build Integration) with full end-to-end success, we need robust CI/CD testing to:
- **Prevent Regressions**: Catch API compatibility issues before production
- **Accelerate Development**: Fast feedback loops for developers
- **Ensure Quality**: Validate complete workflows on real OpenShift clusters
- **Enable Confidence**: Automated testing for every PR and merge

**Dual Testing Strategy:**
1. **Kind (Local)**: Tier 1 tests only - Fast feedback for developers (< 2 min)
2. **OpenShift (CI/CD)**: All tiers (1, 2, 3) - Comprehensive validation (10-15 min)

**Test Tier Organization:**
- **Tier 1**: Simple validation (< 30s) - Basic notebook execution, no builds, no models
- **Tier 2**: Intermediate complexity (1-5 min) - S2I/Tekton builds, dependencies, model training
- **Tier 3**: Complex integration (5-30 min) - Model inference, external secrets, KServe/OpenShift AI

Based on ADR-008 (Notebook Testing Strategy), the following testing approach will be used:

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Controller reconciliation logic
- [ ] Secret resolution (HTTPS, SSH)
- [ ] Error classification (Transient/Retriable/Terminal)
- [ ] Status condition updates
- [ ] Retry logic and backoff calculation
- [ ] Log sanitization
- [ ] Metrics recording

### Integration Tests
- [ ] End-to-end validation workflow
- [ ] Git clone with real repositories (HTTPS and SSH)
- [ ] Pod creation and monitoring
- [ ] Status updates from pod events
- [ ] Error handling and retry scenarios
- [ ] Prometheus metrics collection

### E2E Tests with Test Notebooks
- [ ] **Tier 1 (Simple)**: Hello World, Data Validation, Error Handling
  - Execution time: <30 seconds
  - Memory: <100Mi
  - Run on: Every PR
- [ ] **Tier 2 (Intermediate)**: Data Analysis, Feature Engineering
